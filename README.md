# Raw data

This public repository contains the experimental and theoretical databases used for RNA backbone rotamers classification using 13C' chemical shifts. 

Two documents were uploaded:

(1) ExperimentalDatabase.csv

(2) TheoreticalDatabase.csv

In both of them, the column DN refers to 'dinucleotide' and contains the base identities and numbers. 
The column SEQ refers to 'sequence' and contains the dinucleotide base sequence. 
In (1) the term CS in the column names, refers to 'chemical shift'. The column PDBID contains the PDB id of the RNA structure. The column MODEL contains the model number from te NMR ensemble.

In (2) the term shielding is used in spite of chemical shift because its the isotropic 13C shielding value obtained from DFT computations.
